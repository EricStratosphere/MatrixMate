# MatrixMate
A console-based application created for Linear Algebra students. This application is capable, in its current state, of performing basic Matrix operations.

# Features and Tools Used
MatrixMate so far is made entirely in C#. As of today, it is capable of performing these features:
- Matrix Addition
- Matrix Multiplication (Matrix-to-Matrix and Scalar-to-Matrix)
- Inverse Matrix Calculation
- Gauss-Jordan Elimination (Conversion of a System of Linear Equations to Reduced-Row Echelon)
- Calculating Determinants

Future Features to be implemented:
- A Graphical User Interface for ease of use.
- LU-factorization for Matrix.

# How to use
Upon opening of the application, you will immediately be met by the program asking for two user-inputs. The row-size of your matrix, and the column-size of
